What I found interesting about this article is the idea of computing with a conscience. Unfortunately, in today's society the applications of computer science typically tend to be geared towards advertising to consumers and the centralization of data. Computer science is such a wonderful and powerful tool that can be applied to genuinely benefit people's lives, but a huge portion of the job market revolves around exploting user data. Web3 and decentralization allows a new means of creating applications. There are flaws with the current means of using Web3, but the potential of the technology is too big to ignore. Adoption is what is necessary and improvements upon the technology can allow people to use the computing power at our hands in a more wholesome manner.
